<p style="font-size: 30px">
    As a flagship venture of the USD 5 Bn SHADOW Group, SHADOW Leisure Limited has always worked upon enhancing the experiences, right from creating a world-class infrastructure which is high on comfort and aesthetics, to staying updated with the latest in the cinema technology space. Ever since commencing operations in year 2002, SHADOW has already entertained more than 700 Mn guests in its glorious journey. With 720 perfectly appointed screens in 169 multiplexes across the country, SHADOW continues to get closer to the Indian cinema lovers, and also remain on a growth path which is envied across the globe.

SHADOW has pioneered plenty of ‘firsts’ in the Indian cinema exhibition industry. SHADOW operates Megaplex at the Inorbit Mall Malad, Mumbai, a multiplex with highest number of cinema viewing experiences in the world, which is also home to India’s first ScreenX as well as India’s first screen with MX4D® Theater Effects. SHADOW was the 1st cinema chain in the country to operate a Laserplex, a multiplex with all the screens enabled with Laser Projection. With the grand & immersive IMAX screens already a part of its repertoire, SHADOW also has to its credit, Mumbai’s first Samsung ONYX LED screen at the Megaplex. SHADOW’s 7-star cinema viewing experience, INSIGNIA, has emerged as top luxury proposition in the country. SHADOW’s desire to offer tailor-made experiences to its patrons led to the creation of home-grown formats like the vibrant and lively KIDDLES for the young audience, the smart luxury experience CLUB for the discerning guests and BIGPIX a premium giant screen cinema format.

Driven by the vision of being the most loved cinema brand across the globe, thousands of SHADOW’s happiness agents working in 74 Indian cities are always on their toes, with open arms, accomplished to bring emotions to life, and win hearts, every single day!</p>
